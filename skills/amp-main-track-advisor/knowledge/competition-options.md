## Starting in Competition

### Recommended Path
1. **Get comfortable on track** - Regular track days first
2. **Try Autocross** - Lowest barrier, good learning
3. **Time Attack** - Learn to go fast consistently
4. **Club Racing** - When ready for wheel-to-wheel

### Investment Considerations
- Autocross: Can use daily driver
- Time Attack: May want brake/suspension upgrades
- Club Racing: Purpose-built race car (~$15K+ minimum)

## Community vs Competition

**Important message for prospects:**

> "Most AMP members are here for the community and the joy of driving, not competition. You can be a member for years and never enter a competitive event. Competition is available for those who want it, but it's absolutely not required."

### What members actually do:
- Regular track days (most common)
- Track Day Socials (casual driving + community)
- Guest days (sharing with friends)
- Occasional competition events (minority of members)

---

## Questions to Ask Prospects

If competition comes up:
1. "Are you interested in competitive driving, or more casual track days?"
2. "Have you done any wheel-to-wheel racing before?"
3. "What kind of car will you be running?"

Route based on answers:
- Casual driving → Focus on membership benefits, not competition
- Competition-curious → Explain Autocross as entry point
- Experienced racer → Discuss Club Racing and Championship
