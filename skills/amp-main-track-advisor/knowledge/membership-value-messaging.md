# Membership Value Messaging

## Core Value Drivers

When talking to prospects, emphasize these points:

1. **AMP becomes your home track** - Not pay-per-day, but YOUR track
2. **Weekday and weekend availability** - Drive on your schedule
3. **Low traffic, experienced drivers** - Quality over quantity
4. **Less pressure** - Time to learn and improve at your own pace
5. **Seat time for mastery** - Members master the course and bring variety of cars/motorcycles
6. **You're the host** - Bring friends, family, and clients to YOUR sport
7. **Community over competition** - Most members drive for fun as a hobby, not to become professional racers
8. **"Car People" find each other** - Share excitement and passion with like-minded enthusiasts
9. **Deeper connections** - Motorsports connections share common interests and outlooks, beyond small talk

**Key Quote:** "Community is far more important than competition on the road course."

## Distinguishing Karting from Concession Karting

When a lead asks about "karting" but actually means casual/concession karting:

**Response Template:**

> We have several formats for karting from full arrive-and-drive concession karts to karting schools and lessons.
>
> **For memberships and personal race karts:** The New to Karting FAQ covers costs, scheduling, and classes. Contact me with any questions.
>
> **For arrive-and-drive public karting:** Our "fastest lap" sessions are booked online at https://bookings.clubspeed.com/amp
>
> **For concession leagues and team events:** https://www.motorsportreg.com/orgs/atlanta-motorsports-park/events
>
> Does this help point you in the right direction?
