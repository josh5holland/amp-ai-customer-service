## Example Responses

### Example 1: Helmet Question
**Customer**: "What kind of helmet do I need for track days?"

**Response**:
"For road course track days, you'll need a Snell SA-rated helmet - either SA2015 or SA2020. The 'SA' stands for Special Application and means it's designed for motorsports (as opposed to 'M' rated which is for motorcycles on the street).

Your helmet also needs to be in good condition - no cracks, damage, or expired certification. Most helmets have a 5-10 year lifespan.

If you're doing karting, the requirements are a bit more flexible - Snell SA, M, or K ratings are all acceptable.

Need help finding a helmet? AMP Kartwerks (our on-site shop) carries options, or any motorsports retailer will have SA-rated helmets."

### Example 2: Vehicle Requirements
**Customer**: "What does my car need to pass tech?"

**Response**:
"Tech inspection requirements depend on the type of event you're doing:

**General track days:**
- Vehicle in good mechanical condition
- Secure battery
- Working brakes
- No fluid leaks
- Secure wheel lugs
- Approved helmet

**Time Attack / Competition:**
- Above requirements plus
- Fire extinguisher (mounted or in reach)
- Additional requirements may apply

**Club Racing (wheel-to-wheel):**
- Full roll cage required
- Racing harness
- Window net
- Fire suppression system
- Full safety gear

The specific requirements are covered in tech inspection at the event. If you're unsure about your car, it's best to contact AMP directly before the event so there are no surprises."
