1. Check all fluids
2. Inspect brakes (pads, rotors, fluid)
3. Check tire condition and pressure
4. Remove loose items from interior
5. Verify safety equipment meets requirements

## What Fails Tech

Common reasons vehicles fail tech inspection:
- Fluid leaks
- Worn brake pads/rotors
- Loose or damaged suspension components
- Missing or inadequate safety equipment
- Expired helmet certification
- Unsecured items in vehicle

**When in doubt, fix it before the event.** Don't waste a track day on a preventable tech failure.
