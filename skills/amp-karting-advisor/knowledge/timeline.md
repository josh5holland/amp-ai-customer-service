- **Skipping instruction** - Leads to bad habits
- **Wrong equipment** - Buying before understanding needs
- **Unrealistic expectations** - Racing isn't instant

## What Accelerates Progress

- **Consistent practice** - 2+ days per month minimum
- **Quality instruction** - Schools + private lessons
- **Proper equipment** - Right kart for your class
- **Video analysis** - Review your driving
- **Community involvement** - Learn from other members

## Setting Proper Expectations

### First Race Goals
- Finish the race
- Follow all rules and flags
- Avoid contact with other karts
- Have fun and learn

### NOT First Race Goals
- Win
- Set fastest lap
- Qualify on pole

**Philosophy:** The first race is about experience, not results. Most successful karters took time to develop their skills before becoming competitive.
