# Karting Membership FAQ

## How Karting Membership Works

Atlanta Motorsports Park is a private motorsports country club. Karting members bring their own karts to practice during member-only track days. A normal week includes Thursday, Friday, and alternating weekend days for karting.

**Member Calendar:** https://theclub.atlantamotorsportspark.com/calendar/

From March to October, we host monthly club races including classes from kid karts to adults. Members receive a discount to sign up, and non-members can also join for race day.

**Recommendation:** Practice and hire instructors to get lap times close to race pace before entering your first race. Development typically takes 3-6 months after becoming a member.

## Kart Setup

Kart fitting is like shopping for running shoes - each driver has a seat size that fits them. Seat, pedals, and steering wheel are fixed to fit the driver.

As drivers gain skill:
- Alignment adjustments
- Front/rear width changes
- Ballast weight for weight requirements
- Goal: predictable handling, high grip

**Basic prep before track:**
- Lubricate chain and bearings
- Check for loose bolts
- Add fuel
- Set tire pressures
