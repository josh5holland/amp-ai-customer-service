Here's your path from new kart owner to racing:

After school, consider a private lesson for personalized feedback on your specific kart and driving.

Check the member calendar at theclub.atlantamotorsportspark.com/calendar/
Start with practice to:
- Learn the track
- Get comfortable with your kart
- Build consistency

**Step 4: Club Racing**
After 5-10 practice days and when you feel confident, enter a club race. Focus on finishing and learning, not winning!

**Timeline:**
Typical path from membership to first race: 3-6 months

**Equipment checklist:**
- Helmet (Snell SA, M, or K)
- Rib protector
- Closed-toe shoes
- Kart with proper safety equipment
