## Common Questions

### "Can my 4-year-old do Junior Discovery?"
No, minimum age is 5. There are no programs available for children under 5.

### "Is this a birthday party option?"
Yes! Junior Discovery can be a great birthday activity for kids 5-11.

### "Will they race other kids?"
The focus is on learning, not competition. They'll do activities on a cone course, not wheel-to-wheel racing.

### "What if they love it and want to do more?"
Consider Karting School ($549) as the next step, or talk to us about the race karting membership path for serious competitive karting.
